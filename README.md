# Welcome to ExploreOS!

Hi! This project was made for the curious, like me! This project is created to explore **Operating system** development (OSDev). Feel free to look around, fork or whatever you deem fit.


# Why?
I have **always** been interested in how and why operating systems operate, therefore i set out on a quest to figure it out. As someone that usually writes in either Java-script and Php, this was a *very* difficult subject to grasp for me. Other than being a *very* tough project to understand and write, it has also been a pleasure to learn about OSDev and all the little things about c/asm. 

# Goals
#### Achievable:
* File-system
	* Very simple system for storing files
* Working terminal 
	* User input/output
	* Writing/Reading to/from file (requires file-system)
#### Possible with more reading and help:
* Empty for now, since my knowledge is so limited, feel free to add!

# Wanna contribute?
### Prerequisites:
| Name | Description |
|--|--|
| **GCC-Cross-Compiler** | Compiles the code an give an .ISO file |
| **Qemu** | Runs the .ISO on a light virtual-machine |

### Other than that...
Go right ahead! Even if you don't know *anything* about OSDev, give it a try. You are an expert on the subject? Even better! Your contribution will - other than expanding the project - also help me a lot in exploring the world of OSDev! Therefore I believe ***any*** contribution will be a wonderful addition!
